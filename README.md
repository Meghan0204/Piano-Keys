# Piano Keys

A responsive interactive piano keyboard web page built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates front‑end development skills in building interactive UI elements and handling user input events.

## Overview

This repository contains the source files for a **Piano Keys** web application that lets users play piano sounds by pressing keyboard keys or clicking on onscreen piano keys. The project highlights the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and event handling.

## Features

✔ Interactive piano keyboard  
✔ Sound playback triggered by keyboard presses or mouse clicks  
✔ Clean layout and responsive design  
✔ Fundamental DOM manipulation and event logic

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – page structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – interaction logic and sound control  

---

## How It Works

1. **HTML** defines the piano keys and layout.  
2. **CSS** styles the key elements and layout to resemble a piano keyboard.  
3. **JavaScript** listens for keyboard events and click events to play corresponding audio files.  
4. Sound files are mapped to specific keys so pressing a key or clicking its onscreen counterpart plays the correct note.

This project demonstrates practical use of **DOM manipulation**, **event listeners**, and **audio playback** in a browser context.
